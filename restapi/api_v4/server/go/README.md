# Go API Server for swagger

## Authorization  Step by step instruction how to use Watson Machine Learning service can be found [here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/PredictiveModeling/using_pm_service_dsx.html#using_pm_service_dsx)  ### IBM Watson Machine Learning Credentials  To start working with API one needs to generate an `access token` using the `username` and `password` available on the Service Credentials tab of the IBM Watson Machine Learning service instance or also available in the VCAP environment variable.  Example of the Service Credentials:  ```json {     \"url\": \"https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com\",     \"access_key\": \"ERY9vcBfE4sE+F4g8hcotF9L+j81WXWeZv\",     \"username\": \"c1ef4b80-2ee2-458e-ab92-e9ca97ec657d\",     \"password\": \"030528d4-5a3e-4d4c-9258-5d553513be6f\",     \"instance_id\": \"a751c209-954e-dc32-b441-ad56ce7a9f40\" } ```  Example of obtaining `access token` from Token Endpoint using HTTP Basic Auth (for details please refer to Token section below):  ` curl --basic --user username:password https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/v4/identity/token `  The obtained `access token` needs to be prepended with `Bearer` word and it needs to be passed in the `Authorization` header for API calls.  Example of API request with `Bearer access token`:  ` curl https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/v4/models -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0ZW5hbnRJZCI6ImU4YmQzZGM3LWI5Y2UtNDY1OC1iZ...\" `
